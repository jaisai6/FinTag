# Intent Classification and Entity Tagging in Financial Field

## Abstract
The critical analysis and understanding of financial texts largely depend on techniques like intent
classification and entity extraction. The former technique aims to discern a text's underlying
intention or purpose, whereas the latter focuses on identifying and extracting specific data from
the text. These approaches play a pivotal role in streamlining and automating the analysis and
processing of financial documents, making them more understandable to machine learning
systems. This dissertation offers an in-depth exploration of these techniques as applied in the
financial sphere, discussing their challenges and potential. The primary objective is to give a
complete picture of the current cutting-edge methodologies in this field while also providing
useful insights for both researchers and practitioners intrigued by the application of these
techniques in the analysis of financial documents. We utilized a comprehensive approach,
Multiple Novel Intent Detection (MNID), which identifies and classifies new intents in financial
reports and documents. The MNID framework effectively manages new, unexplored intents with
the help of clustering, annotation, and retraining methods. Our assessment of the MNID
framework using financial natural language understanding datasets (Finer-139) demonstrated
performance superior to other established benchmarks.

## Conclusion
The MNID framework, a
novel approach for detecting and categorizing new intents in conversational agents was
employed in this study. By combining clustering, annotation, and retraining, the MNID
framework adeptly manages new intents that were previously unencountered. When evaluated on
a Natural Language Understanding (NLU) dataset, Finer-139, this framework exhibited superior
performance when compared to competitive baselines (instances where data points for each new
class are provided).
